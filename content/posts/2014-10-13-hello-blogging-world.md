title: Hello blogging world :)

so after several months—if not years—of procrastinating whether I should or should not blog, I've finally decided to leave my comfort zone and face
my greatest fear—blogging!!
<!--more-->

I've been 'blogging' locally on my laptop & workstation just taking simple notes of problems I've faced & how I tackled them.
On few cases, I would place these notes on a private gist on [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/oguya), then I would share them with my colleagues.

I guess it's time to go public & share everything with everyone out there, after all I'm a big fan on Free & Open Source Software(FOSS).

Watch this space for more to come!

_Adios_
